### Security Best Practices for Users

When using NullScan:

1. **Permission**: Only scan systems you own or have explicit permission to test
2. **Rate Limiting**: Use appropriate concurrency settings to avoid overwhelming targets
3. **Network Isolation**: Run scans from isolated environments when possible
4. **Log Security**: Secure scan results that may contain sensitive information
5. **Updates**: Keep NullScan updated to the latest version

### Common Security Considerations

- NullScan performs network scanning which may be detected by security systems
- Banner grabbing may expose service information
- High concurrency scans may trigger rate limiting or blocking
- Always comply with local laws and regulations
